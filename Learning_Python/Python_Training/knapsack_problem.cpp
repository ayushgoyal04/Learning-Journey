// Knapsack Problem
/*
items
weights : [1, 2, 3, 8]
valuation : [2, 5, 8, 9]
max bag weight : 10 [constraint]
// Find the maximum valuation that can be achieved with the given weights and valuation

there are two sub problesm, factional knapsack and 0/1 knapsack
1. Fractional Knapsack: You can take fractions of items, meaning you can take a portion of an item if it exceeds the weight limit.
2. 0/1 Knapsack: You can either take the whole item or leave it
*/

/*
0/1 knapsack problem example
w [1, 3, 5, 7]
v [2, 6, 7, 10]
max weight = 8

v/w [2, 2, 1.4, 1.4]
we do nto get optimum value by v/w ratio-> here we will get 1 + 3 = 4 and nothign else can be added
Hence we use the dynamic programmign approach

// fractional knapsac can be solved by the v/w approach but not the 0/1 knapsack
