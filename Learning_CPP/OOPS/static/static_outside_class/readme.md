## Understanding `static` in C++

### 1. Static Outside a Class or Struct

When you declare a variable or function as `static` outside a class or struct (i.e., at file scope), it means:
- **Internal Linkage:** The symbol (variable or function) is only visible within the translation unit (source file) where it is declared. It cannot be accessed from other files, even if you use `extern`.
- **Example:**
```cpp
// file1.cpp
static int counter = 0; // Only visible in file1.cpp
static void helper() { /* ... */ } // Only visible in file1.cpp
```

### 2. Static Inside a Class or Struct

When you declare a member as `static` inside a class or struct:
- **Shared Across All Instances:** The static member belongs to the class itself, not to any particular object. All instances share the same static member.
- **No 'this' Pointer:** Static members do not have access to the `this` pointer, so they cannot access non-static members directly.
- **Must Be Defined Outside the Class:** Static data members must be defined outside the class (unless they are `constexpr` in C++17+).
- **Can Be Accessed Without an Object:** You can access static members using the class name.
- **Example:**
```cpp
struct MyStruct {
	static int count;
	int value;
	static void increment() { count++; }
};

int MyStruct::count = 0; // Definition outside the struct

MyStruct a, b;
a.value = 1;
b.value = 2;
MyStruct::increment(); // count is now 1
```

### 3. Static in Structs

- **Same Rules as Classes:** In C++, structs and classes are almost identical except for default access (structs are public by default, classes are private). Static members in structs behave exactly as in classes.
- **Example:**
```cpp
struct S {
	static int shared;
	int instance;
};
int S::shared = 42;
```

### 4. Niche and Advanced Info

- **Static Functions in Classes/Structs:** Can be called without an object. Useful for utility functions related to the class but not to a specific instance.
- **Static Local Variables:** Inside a function, `static` means the variable retains its value between calls and is only visible in that function.
```cpp
void foo() {
	static int call_count = 0;
	call_count++;
}
```
- **Thread Safety:** Static members are shared, so be careful with concurrency.
- **Constexpr Static Members:** Since C++17, you can define `constexpr static` members inside the class.
- **Static in Templates:** Each template instantiation gets its own static member.

### Summary Table
| Context                | Meaning of `static`                                      |
|------------------------|---------------------------------------------------------|
| File scope             | Internal linkage (not visible outside the file)          |
| Inside class/struct    | Shared member, belongs to class/struct, not instance     |
| Inside function        | Retains value between calls, only visible in function    |

Static is a powerful keyword in C++ for controlling scope, lifetime, and sharing of data. Use it thoughtfully for encapsulation and resource management.
